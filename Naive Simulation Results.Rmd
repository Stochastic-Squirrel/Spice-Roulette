## Background

Sliders are a great way to sample the tastes of many burgers. They typically come in 3's and are miniature versions of the full meal. 

![](resources/sliders_image.jpg)

I was at a popular burger restaurant with two friends a while ago. On the menu, there was an option to play "Burger Roulette" when you ordered sliders. How it works is that if you order a plate of sliders (3 burgers on a plate), one of them will be loaded with very hot chilis. As a result, the three of us each ordered a different plate of sliders where one burger on each plate was loaded with very hot chilis.

The plan was that we would swap burgers between ourselves randomly as we wanted to taste from each others' selection.
I thought to myself, what are the chances that I get all three spicy burgers on my plate?


## Assumptions

* I presumed that you have absolutely no idea as to which burger contains the chilis. We would be naively swapping burgers.

* There is a strict order of swapping. Player 1 and 2 will exchange burgers, then 2 and 3. Finally, 3 and 1 will swap.


## Script Logic

I used the `tidyverse` and `doParallel` packages in conducting the simulation. I start by setting up a parallel cluster and creating the burger swapping index function.

```{r , eval=FALSE}
swapping_positions <- function(number,min,max){
  runif(n = number,min,max) %>% round(digits = 0)
}
```
A uniform random variable is created with a lower and upper bound of min and max. This number is then rounded to an integer. This will be the burger index that player A will choose from player B.

The script will use the `swapping_positions` function to exchange boolean elements between players for a given number of games at a round size (r). An element is `TRUE` when it is a spicy burger. The round size refers to how many swapping rounds there will be per game. If r = 3 , the process as described in the second assumption will be performed 3 times per game.

The script used is available as `spicy_roulette.R`.
